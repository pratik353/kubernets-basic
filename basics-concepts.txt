# Core terms
1. Control panel ---> it's control plane which help us to interact with worker nodes
2. worker nodes ---> it contains all deployment and services e.g. mongo : deployment and exposing mongo url(services) , web-app :  deployment and exposing web-app url(services)
3. Kubectl ( kubernets command line tool ) --> used to work with control plane
4. secretes ---> these are global secret variables which you can use anywhere
5. Config ----> these are global variables which you can use anywhere eg. dbURL

6. minikubes ---> minicubes contains all ( control plane and worker nodes ) ---> it's an environment separate from kubectl

7. nodePort ---> node port is url which we want to expose to external users e.g. webapp-url



to perform all fo these we need to install kubernets and minikubes

## installation on windows
1. with chocolaty :
    install chocolaty

    install kubectl :- 
    run command --> choco install kubernetes-cli  // It will install kubectl on machine

    install minikube :- 
    run in powershell --> choco install minikube


## secret:-
    keep your all secrets are separate e.g. mongo-secrets.yaml, web-app secrets.yaml


## config:- 
    configMaps :- A ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs

## deployments:-
    You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.
    You just tell this file how many pods and worker nodes you need. And it will set them

## service:-
    In Kubernetes, a Service is a method for exposing a network application that is running as one or more Pods in your cluster.



## COMMANDS OF Kubectl

1. kubectl get pod --> get running pods
2. kubectl apply -f <FILE_NAME> ---> create instance in kubernets environment
3. kubectl get secret --> gives you all secrets that are created
4. kubectl get ConfigMap  --> gives all configMap which are created
5. kubectl get svc  --> gives you all services 
6. minikube ip   --> gives you exact IP where this minikube is running --> used to listen our app
7. minikube service <SERVICE_NAME>  ---> gives ypu webapp service ip where it running

8. kubectl delete deployment --all    --> remove all deployment which are created in pods
9. kubectl delete service --all    --> remove all service which are created in pods
10. kubectl delete secret --all    --> remove all secret which are created in pods
11. kubectl delete configMap --all    --> remove all configMap which are created in pods
